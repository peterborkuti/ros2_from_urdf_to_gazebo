## Steps



1. create a robot in URDF with xacro with fixed joints and view it in rviz2
2. add gazebo elements to URFD to view robot in gazebo
3. change fixed joints with movable joints
4. control robot with rviz2 and joint_state_publisher_gui
5. control robot with python3 and watch it in rviz
6. create a gazebo model
7. create a gazebo world
8. add gazebo plugin to world and model to move it from ros2 topics and view it in gazebo
9. add gazebo plugin to world and model to watch its joint states from ros2 topics


## Prerequisites

ubuntu, ros2 foxy, gazebo-11, setup ros2 and colcon, have ros2_ws ros2 workspace, be familiar with colcon, topics, ros2 packages, basic ros2 tutorials
